### Justification
- **Punctuality:** In the Commitment Agreement with them (**pilotUsersCommitmentAgreementGrupo11.md**), it was stated that the prototype along with the form was to be interchanged between the groups by March 24th at 23:59 to begin the testing the 25th and have it finished by the 27th at 23:59. Our group delivered it to them on time, however, group 11 delivered it to us on the 27th ar 16:11. Also, the prototype group 11 delivered was from Sprint 1. 
We also agreed that 8 people from each group would test each other's prototype. By March 27th at 23:59 8 people from our group had tested their software but only 6 people from their group had tested ours.
- **Feedback validity:** About a quarter of the feedback delivered to us was about features that we declared that were not implemented yet in our feedback form, like user authentication. Said feedback form's content can be consulted in **pilots.md**.
- **Feedback amount:** They gave us a lot of feedback. They answered the form and provided a lot of information. Additionally, they delivered as a PDF file including a few more feedback points.
- **Fellowship:** When both groups were discussing the terms (a few days before March 24th), our group requested more flexibility with the prototype's submission. The reason was that our team was not able to deploy our application backend during Sprint 1 because, after many hours put into it, it simply did not work. Because of this, our team wanted more time for the deployment process. Their answer was clear. They would not give us more team nor would help us deploy our application, even though they both use the same backend technology, and we asked for their help for both our groups' sake. So, finally, our team, after a lot of effort, managed to deploy the backend in App Engine on March 23rd, having it before the deadline. However, in the end, as we explained in the **Punctuality** section, they were the ones who did not respect the deadline.
