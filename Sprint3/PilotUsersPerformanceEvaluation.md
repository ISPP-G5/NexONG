### Justification Sprint 2
- **Punctuality:** In the Commitment Agreement with them (**pilotUsersCommitmentAgreementGrupo11.md**), it was stated that the prototype along with the form was to be interchanged between the groups by March 24th at 23:59 to begin the testing the 25th and have it finished by the 27th at 23:59. Our group delivered it to them on time, however, group 11 delivered it to us on the 25th at 16:11. Also, the prototype group 11 delivered was from Sprint 1. 
We also agreed that half of the people from each group would test each other's prototype. By March 27th at 23:59 8 people from our group (we are 16 in the group) had tested their software but only 6 people from their group had tested ours (they are 14 on the group).
- **Feedback validity:** About a quarter of the feedback delivered to us was about features that we declared that were not implemented yet in our feedback form, like user authentication. Said feedback form's content can be consulted in **pilots.md**.
- **Feedback amount:** They gave us a lot of feedback. They answered the form and provided a lot of information. Additionally, they delivered as a PDF file including a few more feedback points.
- **Fellowship:** When both groups were discussing the terms (a few days before March 24th), our group requested two things:
	- More flexibility with the prototype's submission. The reason was that our team was not able to deploy our application backend during Sprint 1 because, after a many hours put in it, it simply did not work. Because of this, our team wanted more time for the deployment process. Their answer was clear. They would not give us more time nor would help us deploy our application, even though they both use the same backend technology and asked for their help for both our groups' sake. So, finally, our team, after a lot of effort, managed to deploy the backend in App Engine on March 23rd, having it before the deadline. However, in the end, as we explained in the **Punctuality** section, they were the ones that did not respect the deadline.
	- Testing by everyone on their team. Our team's idea from the beginning was that every person on their team would perform pilot user testing. However, they did not cede once and demanded that eight people from each team do the testing. We had to adapt for them, even though at the end only 6 of them tested and gave feedback.


### Justification Sprint 3
- **Punctuality:** In the Commitment Agreement with them (**pilotUsersCommitmentAgreementGrupo11.md**), it was stated that the prototype along with the form was to be interchanged between the groups by April 14th at 23:59 to begin the testing the 15th and have it finished by April 17th at 23:59. Our group delivered it to them on time, however, group 11 delivered it to us on the 15th at 17:19 (and not in the landing page as it should). After checking the software, the coordinator María Núñez talked to the coordinator of Aparking about a failure in the software and she admmitted that the prototype delivered was from the previous Sprint (software that we have already tested). 
We also agreed that half of the people from each group would test each other's prototype. By April 17th at 23:59, the corresponding 7 people from their group had tested our prototype.
